# jenkins-automations
Real case scenarios for Jenkins Declarative pipelines.

I usually work with:
-AWS
-CloudFoundry
-Jira
-Bitbucket
-Docker
So in the repository you can find different automations with integrations related to those tools.

# Structure of this repo
You will find different folders because inside of each of those you will find Jenkinsfiles and all the related SHELL scripts needed to perform an automation.
The name of each folder is pretty much explicative of what kind of automations you will find in there.
